## Dependencies

```r
    MASS
    cubature
    lhs
    data.tree
    dbarts
    matrixStats
    mvtnorm
```

##To run the genz integrals approximations:

1) Install the dependencies in `R`. Make sure you are using **R 3.5.0** or higher.


2) In the terminal, `cd` to `src`

3) Run

```
Rscript integrationMain.R dimension num_iterations genz_function_number

```
where `genz_function_number` is following the indexing in https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/integration.html. 

This will generate the results in `../results`, where you can take a look at the `.csv` files or automatically generated graphs.

4) If you want to tune the GP integral, you can also run

```
Rscript GPRunTime.R dimension num_iterations genz_function_number initial_training_set_size
```

Results will similarly be in `../results`.
