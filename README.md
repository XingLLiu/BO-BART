## Dependencies

```r
    yaml
    MASS
    cubature
    lhs
    data.tree
    dbarts
    matrixStats
    mvtnorm
    doParallel
    kernlab
    msm
    dbarts_0.9-8
```

## To run the genz integrals approximations:

1) Install all the necessary packages

```r
install.packages(c("yaml", "MASS", "cubature", "lhs", "data.tree", "matrixStats", "mvtnorm", "doParallel", "kernlab", "msm"))

# an old version of dbarts
packageurl <- "https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/dbarts/dbarts_0.9-8.tar.gz"
install.packages(packageurl, repos=NULL, type="source")
```

2) To reproduce the benchmark tests, run `integrationMain.R` with customized inputs. There are 7 arguments in total, of which the last two are optional. The last argument should only be specified when the step function is used (`genz_function_number = 7`), and is set to `1` if not specified. For example:
```
Rscript integrationMain.R dimension num_iterations genz_function_number kernel_name sequential_flag (measure) (number_of_jumps_for_step_function)

```
where `genz_function_number` follows the indexing in this [documentation](https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/integration.html) for the Genz families. The results will be stored in `results`, where you can find the `.csv` files containing the numerical values and the automatically generated graphs.

3) If you want to tune the GP integral, you can also run

```
Rscript GPRunTime.R dimension num_iterations genz_function_number initial_training_set_size
```

Results will also be stored in `results`.

## To test the design with real-life data with provided

1) Install the dependencies in `R`. Make sure you are using **R 3.5.0** or higher.

2) In the terminal, `cd` to `src/meanPopulationStudy`

3) Run

```
Rscript poptMean.R num_iterations

```

This will generate and store the results in `meanPopulationStudy`, where you can find the `.csv` files containing the numerical values and the automatically generated graphs.
