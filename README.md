## Dependencies

```r
    MASS
    cubature
    lhs
    data.tree
    dbarts
    matrixStats
    mvtnorm
```

## To run the genz integrals approximations:

1) Install all the necessary packages

```
install.packages(c("yaml", "MASS", "cubature", "lhs", "data.tree", "matrixStats", "mvtnorm", "doParallel", "kernlab"))
```
and also 
```
packageurl <- "https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/dbarts/dbarts_0.9-8.tar.gz"
install.packages(packageurl, repos=NULL, type="source")
```

2) To simulate, run the test scripts with customized inputs. There are 6 inputs in total; the last input is optional and only works for the step function (_genz_function_number_ = 7). For example:
```
Rscript integrationMain.R dimension num_iterations genz_function_number sequential_flag kernel_name (number_of_jumps_for_step_function)

```
where `genz_function_number` is following the indexing in https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/integration.html. 

This will generate the results in `../results`, where you can take a look at the `.csv` files or automatically generated graphs.

4) If you want to tune the GP integral, you can also run

```
Rscript GPRunTime.R dimension num_iterations genz_function_number initial_training_set_size
```

Results will similarly be in `../results`.

## To test the design in real-life data with provided dataset

1) Install the dependencies in `R`. Make sure you are using **R 3.5.0** or higher.

2) In the terminal, `cd` to `meanPopulationStudy`

3) Run

```
Rscript poptMean.R num_iterations

```

This will generate the results in `meanPopulationStudy` where you can take a look at the `.csv` files or automatically generated graphs.
